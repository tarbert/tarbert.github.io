Drum roll please ... we are home with the first of our hire cars.

The 5 door Kia Rios look terrific and are going to be great for the roads on Harris and Lewis. Fitted with DAB digital radios and all wired for Bluetooth, we'll keep a phone charger and extra cables in the glove box to help you stay connected.

They will be available for hire from Monday 23rd March. The cars can be at Stornoway Airport, Stornoway Ferry and Leverburgh Ferry as well as at home with us here in Tarbert for no additional cost. One way hires available.

So, what are you waiting for? Head over to the [Contact](/contact) page and fill in the form or give us a phone. If you don't need a car just now, get connected on our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Isle-of-Harris-car-hire/349699508563610?fref=ts) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harriscarhire) pages and say 'hello'.

We look forward to helping you get around.
