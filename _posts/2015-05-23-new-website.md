We worked with [Digital Freedom](http://digitalfreedom.me/) to build our new website.

We were looking for something modern and a little less ordinary to reflect the way we do business. Something customer friendly and professional. Ranald at Digital Freedom jumped at the chance to work with us as he felt we both had a similar outlook on how best to provide an outstanding service for our customers.

Digital Freedom believe that their Clients have to be part of the team rather than just an end user who receives an inflexible product. We liked that, it allowed us to focus on our business while Ranald got on with his. It's pretty much the same view we have at Isle of Harris Car Hire. 

Feel free to use our [contact](/contact) to ask us questions even if you don't want to make an immediate booking. You can even get in touch with any suggestions of car hire services you'd like to see in Harris and Lewis ... we've a few ideas of our own already, so it is worth connecting with us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Isle-of-Harris-car-hire) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harriscarhire) to keep up to date with our latest news and special offers.
