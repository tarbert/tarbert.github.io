We worked with [Digital Freedom](http://digitalfreedom.me/) to build our new website.

We were looking for something modern and a little less ordinary to reflect the way we do business. Something customer friendly and professional. Ranald at Digital Freedom jumped at the chance to work with us as he felt we both had a similar outlook on how best to provide an outstanding service for our customers.

Digital Freedom believe that their Clients have to be part of the team rather than just an end user who receives an inflexible product. We liked that, it allowed us to focus on our business while Ranald got on with his. He took our suggestions on board regarding our business and customers, and made many useful suggestions himself based on his knowledge of website development.

It's pretty much the same view we have at Isle of Harris Car Hire. We strive to provide the best self drive car hire service in the Hebrides and we feel we can only do that by listening to our customers. That's why we don't have additional costs whether you want to pick your car up from our office in Tarbert, or at the Airport in Stornoway. That's why we don't charge extra if you want to pick your car up at one end of the island and drop it off at the other. That's why we ensure there is a phone charger in the glovebox when you pick your car up. We think these details are important.

Feel free to use our [contact](/contact) form to ask us questions even if you don't want to make an immediate booking. You can even get in touch with any suggestions of car hire services you'd like to see in Harris and Lewis ... we've a few ideas of our own already, so it is worth connecting with us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Isle-of-Harris-car-hire/349699508563610) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harriscarhire) to keep up to date with our latest news and special offers.
