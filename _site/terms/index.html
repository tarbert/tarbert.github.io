<p class="flow-text">Drivers aged 25 to 75, must have held a full licence for atleast 1 year. All hirers must produce a valid drivers licence at time of rental. New style UK photo-licences must be accompanied with the paper counterpart drivers licence. The hirer is responsible for ensuring that the photo-licence is valid; section 4b on the photo-licence.</p>

<p class="flow-text">Drivers over 25 years of age are permitted one at fault accident, and up to 8 penalty points provided there has been no period of disqualification from driving. Drivers over 25 years of age with more than one at fault accident, or any period of disqualification from driving in the last five years, should call with details and we can refer this to our insurers for possible acceptance.</p>

<p class="flow-text">If you are in doubt, please e-mail or call us, and we can confirm eligibility for cover with you.</p>

<p class="flow-text">Please note, only the drivers named on the insurance policy can drive the hire vehicle.</p>

<p class="flow-text">By confirming you have read these terms and conditions, you, the hirer, agree to Isle of Harris – Car Hire, debiting your credit/debit card for the total amount due for the hire period, and also for any additional charges incurred while the vehicle is in your possession.</p>

<h5><strong>Insurance</strong></h5>

<p class="flow-text">All cars have comprehensive insurance cover. The hirer is responsible for the first £750.00 of damage or loss.</p>

<p class="flow-text">Vehicles are only covered for use on classified roads. Damage to the undercarriage of the vehicle as a result of off-road use must be paid for in full, by the hirer.</p>

<p class="flow-text">The hirer is responsible for the full cost of: punctures; damage to windscreen; wheels; wheel trims; tyres; lost keys; damaged keys. Hirers are responsible for ensuring: correct levels of oil; water; tyre pressure.</p>

<p class="flow-text">The cost of damage resulting from incorrect fuel must be paid for in full, by the hirer.</p>

<h5><strong>Care of Vehicle</strong></h5>

<p class="flow-text">All of our rental vehicles are strictly non-smoking, in line with UK legislation. Any evidence of smoking in the hire vehicle will result in a £100 fine.</p>

<p class="flow-text">Vehicles must be returned in a clean condition, with no more than floor mats dirty. The vehicle must be free from sand and litter. Failure to return the vehicle in a reasonable condition will result in a £40.00 valet charge.</p>

<p class="flow-text">Child seats must be kept clean and must not be damaged. Dirty and/or damaged seats will result in a £15.00 service charge.</p>

<h5><strong>Hire Agreement</strong></h5>

<p class="flow-text">Our hire vehicles are covered for use throughout the United Kingdom, however, we do request that you inform us if you are planning on taking the hire car off the island of Lewis & Harris.</p>

<p class="flow-text">Extensions to the agreed rental period are at the discretion of Isle of Harris – Car Hire. Prior agreement is required in order for extension to be considered and approved. It is imperative that we are informed of any required extension before the end of the original hire period, to ensure continual insurance cover.</p>

<p class="flow-text">All vehicles are supplied with a full tank of fuel. If the vehicle is not fully fuelled upon return, a service charge of £15.00 will be incurred by the hirer in addition to the cost of required fuel. The hirer may purchase a full tank of fuel at the beginning of the hire; this relinquishes the requirement to return the car fully fuelled, however, no refund of monies will be given for unused fuel. No additional fees are charged for mileage.</p>

<p class="flow-text">Hire Agreements are made on the understanding that the vehicle will be placed at your disposal on the date agreed. Should this not be possible through circumstances beyond our control, we will provide a substitute vehicle where possible, or a refund of monies.</p>
<p class="flow-text">Full payment of the hire will be taken at commencement of the hire.</p>

<p class="flow-text">Vehicle condition will be agreed at commencement of, and completion of hire; this will be agreed by both parties.</p>

<p class="flow-text">A valid credit card must be presented in order to make a booking. If the hirer wishes to cancel the booking, they must provide 24 hours notice or a charge of 25% of the total cost of the hire will be debited from their credit card. Hires cancelled more than 24 hours before the commencement of the hire will not incur any cancellation fee. If a hirer fails to turn up for the commencement of the hire, then the total cost of the hire will be debited from their credit card.</p>
