We rather like the new 5 door Kia Rio. Actually, we are not alone. 

[What Car](http://www.whatcar.com/car-reviews/kia/rio-hatchback/1-25-1-5dr/summary/70043) describe it as 'worthy of comparison with the best cars in the supermini class', and [Autocar](http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/kia/rio) give it 4.5 stars out of 5. Over 2,500 owners on [reevoo](http://www.kia.co.uk/new-cars/range/compact-cars/new-rio/rio-reviews.aspx) give their Rio a score of 8.9 out of 10.
