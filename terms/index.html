<p class="flow-text">Extensions to the agreed rental period are at the discretion of Isle of Harris – Car Hire. Prior agreement is required in order for extension to be considered and approved. It is imperative that we are informed of any required extension before the end of the original hire period, to ensure continual insurance cover.</p>

If the vehicle is not fully fuelled upon return, a service charge of £15.00 will be incurred by the hirer in addition to the cost of required fuel.

No additional fees are charged for mileage.</p>

<p class="flow-text">Hire Agreements are made on the understanding that the vehicle will be placed at your disposal on the date agreed. Should this not be possible through circumstances beyond our control, we will provide a substitute vehicle where possible, or a refund of monies.</p>

Hires cancelled more than 24 hours before the commencement of the hire will not incur any cancellation fee. If a hirer fails to turn up for the commencement of the hire, then the total cost of the hire will be debited from their credit card.</p>
